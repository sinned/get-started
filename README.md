# Get Started - Project Bootstrap Template

**Version:** 1.0.0

This repository is a **template and starter guide** for bootstrapping new coding projects with AI assistants. It provides a structured workflow to help you and your AI coding agent (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, etc.) initialize new projects from scratch.

## Purpose

This project contains a comprehensive guide (`GET-STARTED.md`) that outlines a proven "Stub → Artifacts → Code" workflow for starting new projects. Instead of jumping straight into code, this approach ensures proper planning and documentation before implementation.

## How to Use

1. **Read the Guide**: Open `GET-STARTED.md` to understand the three-phase workflow
2. **Start Your New Project**: Create a new repository (or use an existing empty one)
3. **Run with Your AI Assistant**: 
   - Share `GET-STARTED.md` with your AI coding assistant
   - Ask it to: *"Follow the instructions in GET-STARTED.md to initialize the repository."*
4. **Let the Workflow Guide You**: The AI will follow the structured phases to:
   - Set up the project skeleton
   - Create planning documents (PRD, TDD, task lists)
   - Implement the code based on your requirements

## What's Included

- **GET-STARTED.md**: A step-by-step guide that AI assistants can follow to bootstrap new projects
- **Three-Phase Workflow**:
  - **Phase 1**: Create project structure and directories
  - **Phase 2**: Build planning artifacts (PRD, TDD, task lists)
  - **Phase 3**: Implement the code based on the plan

## Workflow Overview

The guide follows a structured approach:

1. **Stub Project Structure** - Create directories and basic files without logic
2. **Build Artifacts** - Document requirements and technical design before coding
3. **Implementation** - Execute the plan with proper setup and development

This ensures your project starts with a solid foundation, clear documentation, and a well-thought-out architecture.

## Getting Started

Simply read `GET-STARTED.md` and follow its instructions with your AI coding assistant to bootstrap your next project!
